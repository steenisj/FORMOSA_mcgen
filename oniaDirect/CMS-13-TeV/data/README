The txt files are doubly differential cross-sections
BR(mu mu) * d2sigma/(dpt dy)
in pb/GeV measured in abs(eta)<1.2 in CMS-BPH-15-005
published in Phys. Lett. B 780 (2018) 251

txt2root.py reads the HEPData files and does some
manipulations to provide the "central" value, the
"up" and the "down" variations in root files.

The normalization is dsigma/dPt in nb/GeV for the
rapidity interval abs(y)<1.2
