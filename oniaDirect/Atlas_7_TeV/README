Upsilon measurements from Atlas at 7 TeV.
From Phys.Rev. D87 (2013) 052004, 2013

From HEPData Table 6, 7, and 8 are for 1S, 2S, 3S.

makeOutput.py reads the HEPData files and does some
manipulations to provide the "central" value, the
"up" and the "down" variations in files
Atlas_1S.root
Atlas_2S.root
Atlas_3S.root

The normalization is dsigma/dPt in nb/GeV for the
rapidity interval abs(y)<1.2

There is also a rescaling applied of 13 GeV to 7 GeV
according to the LHCb measurement of this quantity.
