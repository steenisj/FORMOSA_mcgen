atlas_cms_comparison.C
----------------------
Root macro to compare the rescaled 7 TeV Atlas upsilon xsections
with the 13 TeV CMS ones

combineXsec.py
--------------
Reads the upsilon ROOT files for Atlas and CMS from
../CMS_13_TeV/data and ../Atlas_7_Tev
and combines them into output ROOT file for Run 2 (13 TeV)

From_13_to_13p6_TeV.ipynb
-------------------------
Takes ups*_combined.root (Run 2) and rescales it to Run 3.
Output files are then ups*_combined_run3.root and
Run2_to_Run3_scale.pdf

Run2_to_Run3_scale.pdf
----------------------
Scale factors from Run 2 to Run 3

make_pretty_plots.C
-------------------
Root macro to make plots from ups*_combined.root for Run 2 (13 TeV)

ups*_combined.root
------------------
Made by combineXsec.py
Root files with the combined pt spectra of upsilons
from Atlas and CMS.  Files contain "central" value,
the "up" and the "down" variations
The normalization is dsigma/dPt in nb/GeV for the
rapidity interval abs(y)<1.2 for Run 2 (13 TeV)

ups*_combined_run3.root
-----------------------
Same as ups*_combined.root but rescaled for Run 3 (13.6 TeV).
