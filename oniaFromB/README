run2 and run3 folders
---------------------
Folders that contain run2 and run3 stuff

fonll2root.py
-------------
Script to turn the txt file in the run2 and run3 folders into root histograms and make
pretty plots

compare_Run2_Run3.C
-------------------
Root script to make psi*_fromB_*comparison.pdf

psiprime_fromB_Run2_Run3_comparison.pdf psi_fromB_Run2_Run3_comparison.pdf
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparisons of Run2 and Run3 pt spectra.
The blue band is the Run2 variation as a function of Pt from the central value.
(Dashed = up/down, Solid = central = 1.0)
The red band is the ratio of the Run3 spectrum to the central Run2 spectrum.
(Dashed = up/down run3 divided by run2 central, Solid = run3 central/run2 central)
Note that the PDFs have changed between Run2 and Run3.

## Contents of run2 and run3 folders

psi.txt psiprime.txt
---------------------
Tables of cross sections as a function of pt for B->psi B->psiprime
http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~cacciari/fonll/fonllform.html
The kinematical cuts are documented in the files

psi-eta.txt psiprime-eta.txt psi-y.txt psiprime-y.txt
-------------------------------------------------------
Tables of cross sections as a function of eta or y for B->psi B->psiprime
The kinematical cuts are documented in the files (pt<10 is the key)

*.root *.pdf
------------
Outputs of fonll2root.py

psi_total_xsec.txt psiprime_total_xsec.txt
-------------------------------------------
Total cross sections from 
http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~cacciari/fonll/fonllform.html
for the kinematical cuts in psi.txt and psiprime.txt


CAREFUL: The cross-sections are for single b only.
For bbbar they need to be multiplied by 2.
