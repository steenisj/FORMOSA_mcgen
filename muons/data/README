Muon spectra from heavy flavor decays from
http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~cacciari/fonll/fonllform.html

These are in the run2 and run3 directories

Main requirement is abs(eta)<1.
For other details see the text files.

For the total xsection, multiply by 2 (most likely, TBC)

b-to-mu.txt .pdf .root
----------------------
pp -> b -> mu

b-to-c-to-mu.txt .pdf .root
---------------------------
pp -> b -> c -> mu

c-to-mu.txt .pdf .root
----------------------
pp -> c -> mu

b-incl-to-mu.root
-----------------
Output of command

hadd b-incl-to-mu.root b-to-mu.root b-to-c-to-mu.root
This adds the uncertainties linearly, as they probably should,
and is the root file to be used for the generation of all
muons from b decays (including the cascade b->c->mu)

XX_Run2_Run3_comparisons.pdf
----------------------------
Comparisons of Run2 and Run3 muon pt spectra.
The blue band is the Run2 variation as a function of Pt from the central value.
(Dashed = up/down, Solid = central = 1.0)
The red band is the ratio of the Run3 spectrum to the central Run2 spectrum.
(Dashed = up/down run3 divided by run2 central, Solid = run3 central/run2 central)
Note that the PDFs have changed between Run2 and Run3.
